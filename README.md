This is Nathan Dilla and my congresional app project that we did for a school assignment.
We used python and an add on called open-cv to develop a program that used facial recognition.
The end product was a console based output that took user input to create a virtual meeting room. 
Then if a student or other person joined the room the facial recognition would check for a human face, relaying to the host that they are credible.
